# Design Pattrens with CSharp

In this project I will be demonstrating the design pattrens implementation using C#.




## 1. DRY

**DRY** stands for **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself. It's a fundamental principle of software designing, which makes your code more readable, reuseable and scalable. The main idea behind this principle is to reduce your code repetions. 

The DRY principle is stated as *"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, representation within a systemâ€œ*.
