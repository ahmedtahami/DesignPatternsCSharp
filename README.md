# Design Patterns with CSharp

In this project I will be demonstrating the design patterns implementation using C#.




## 1. DRY

**DRY** stands for **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself. It's a fundamental principle of software designing, which makes your code more readable, reuseable and scalable. The main idea behind this principle is to reduce your code repetions. 

The DRY principle is stated as *"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, representation within a systemâ€œ*.

Reference wiki here: [DRYwiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)

The simplest away to achive DRY is make helper classes, extension methods etc. Divide your logic into smaller and reuseable pieces. This design pattern will help you maintaining your code and most importantly saves your efforts in debugging (*the real pain*).
